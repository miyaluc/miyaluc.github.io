      <p>Washington is a beautiful state with huge lakes for people of the state to enjoy.  Here are three of our favorite ones:</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Lake Chelan</h2>
      <img src='lake-chelan.jpg'>
      <p>Lake Chelan is a narrow, 50.5 miles (81.3 km) long lake in Chelan County, north-central Washington state, U.S.[1] It is the largest natural lake in the state by any measure. Upon the completion of Lake Chelan Dam in 1927, the elevation of the lake was increased by 21 feet (6.4 m) to its present maximum-capacity elevation of 1,100 feet (340 m).[2] Two communities lie on the southern end of the lake, and a third sits at the far north end, providing a gateway to the North Cascades National Park.</p>

      <h2>Lake Sammamish</h2>
      <img src='lake-sammamish.jpg'>
      <p>Lake Sammamish is a freshwater lake 8 miles (13 km) east of Seattle in King County, Washington, United States. The lake is 7 miles (11 km) long and 1.5 miles (2 km) wide, with a maximum depth of 105 feet (32 m) and a surface area of 8 sq mi (21 km2).[1] It lies east of Lake Washington and west of the Sammamish Plateau, and stretches from Issaquah in the south to Redmond in the north. At Issaquah it is fed by Issaquah Creek, and at Redmond it drains to Lake Washington via the Sammamish River.</p>
      <p>The 98 sq mi (250 km2) Lake Sammamish watershed stretches from Redmond through Bellevue, and Issaquah to Preston and Hobart, and consists of numerous creeks which flow into the lake. Issaquah Creek is the largest tributary, furnishing over 70% of the lake's inflow.</p>

      <h2>Lake Washington</h2>
      <img src='lake-washington.jpg'>
      <p>Lake Washington is a large freshwater lake adjacent to the city of Seattle. It is the largest lake in King County and the second largest natural lake in the state of Washington, after Lake Chelan. It borders the cities of Seattle on the west, Bellevue and Kirkland on the east, Renton on the south and Kenmore on the north, and encloses Mercer Island. The lake is fed by the Sammamish River at its north end and the Cedar River at its south.</p>
      <p>Lake Washington received its present name in 1854 after Thomas Mercer suggested it be named after George Washington, as the new Washington Territory had been named the year before.[1] Prior names for Lake Washington have included the Duwamish name Xacuab≈° (Lushootseed: literally great-amount-of-water),[2] as well as Lake Geneva, Lake Duwamish, and the Chinook jargon name, "Hyas Chuck," meaning, "Big Lake."</p>
