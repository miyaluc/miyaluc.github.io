        <h2>Mount Rainier</h2>
        <img src="rainier.jpg">
        <p>Mt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list. Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could produce massive mudslides that would threaten the entire Puyallup River valley, and poses a grave threat to the southern sections of the Seattle metropolitan area, a city of over 650,000 people with more than 3.7 million living in its metropolitan area. It has an elevation of 14,409 ft.</p>

        <p>At 10,781 ft, Mt Baker is the third-highest mountain in Washington State and the fifth-highest in the Cascade Range. Indigenous natives have known the mountain for thousands of years, but the first written record of the mountain is from the Spanish. Spanish explorer Gonzalo Lopez de Haro mapped it in 1790 as the Gran Monta√±a del Carmelo, "Great Mount Carmel". It is also one of the snowiest places in the world and beloved by snowboarders and skiiers.</p>

        <img src="helens.jpg">
        <p>Mt St. Helens formed only within the past 40,000 years and it has an elevation 8,366 feet. Streams that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: the Toutle River on the north and northwest, the Kalama River on the west, and the Lewis River on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is 140 inches, and the snow pack on the mountain's upper slopes can reach 16 feet.</p>
